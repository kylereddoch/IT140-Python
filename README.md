These are the scripts that I create while in my Python class at SNHU.

### Scripts

<details>
<summary>Module 1 Labs</summary>

**Lab 1.9**
\
Asks the user for 4 inputs. Then outputs a short story using those 4 inputs.

**Lab 1.10**
\
Asks the user for an integer. Then outputs the users input, then outputs it squared, then cubed. Asks the user for another integer and takes both integers and finds the sum and product. Outputs the sum and product.

**Lab 1.21**
\
Uses integers inputted by user and assigns them to variables user_num and x, then outputs user_num divided by x 3 times.

**Lab 1.22**
\
Uses inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Outputs the average calories burned for a person given those inputs. Then uses the floating-point value to show two digits after the decimal point.

**Lab 1.23**
\
Prompts the user to input an integer between 32 and 126, a float, a character, and a string, storing each into separate variables. Then, outputs those four values on a single line separated by a space. Then outputs those variables in reverse order. Then converts the integer into a character and outputs the character.
